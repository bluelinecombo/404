# 404
Sample 404 page project.

## Taskrunner 
 Gulp 4 

## Frontend Framework 
Boostrap(BS) 4.6

## Overview 
- Built around basic HTML page structure
- Assets purposefully un-minified
- Uses minimal extras outside of BS except for some SCSS mixins, helpers etc
- Strove to stick to default BS wherever possible only breaking out of it where necessary
- Passes Lighthouse accessibility test at 96%


## Issues/Notes
- Nav link color does not pass the AAA color contrast. Changed it to a darker blue that passes AA
- Phone icon is part of font awesome (FA) Pro, so used a different phone icon available in FA free
- Card grid spacing follows BS grid values, so the exact pixels values slightly differ from the design
- The body font uses the BS sans-serif default since you can't sample that from a flat jpeg. The font included only pertains to the heading and button elements.
